# Play Module Seed

Seed project to get you started to write a Playframework 2.5 module. A module is 2.5+'s version of a Play plugin
featuring dependency injection. Reusable generic code should be factored out into independent modules.

You can run a module as if it were a Play app by specifying `reference.conf` as the config file.

To write your own module, simply clone this one, change the package from `com.mariussoutier.play` to yours and look for
everything marked with `TODO`.
